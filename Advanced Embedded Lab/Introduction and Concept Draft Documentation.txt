Like many other smart systems, the management in agriculture can also be enhanced through implementing distributed system with IoT and WSN(Wireless Sensor Network) techniques. Particularly, WSN, a network of decentralized sensor nodes which forward collected data to a central location via wireless connection, enables the users to monitor environmental conditions of the system and to act upon it remotely. 

Our smart agriculture model employs distributed system in which microprocessors and sensors are communicating through WSN techniques. To be more specific, our smart agriculture specifies the environmental constraints to greenhouse where we can manage our crop by handling data from temperature sensors and light sensors. The central communication units, RaspberryPi model in our case, will function as a server where sensors and Arduino Uno work as clients. This will faciliate a bi-directional link between the end-users and the physical space. Then the users can control the system either autonomously or dependently to the users by commanding appropriate execution of the actuators.
